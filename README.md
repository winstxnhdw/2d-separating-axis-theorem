# 2d-separating-axis-theorem
This repository contains a simple C++ implementation of a 2D separating axis algorithm. The algorithm does not compute the [Minimum Translation Vector (MTV)](https://dyn4j.org/2010/01/sat/#sat-mtv) as it is not within my use case. For more information, read [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/collision-detection-using-the-separating-axis-theorem--gamedev-169).

## Test
```bash
g++ main.cpp
./a.out
```
